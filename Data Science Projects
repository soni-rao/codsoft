Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of data science projects. Each project demonstrates practical applications of data science concepts, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
•	Objective: Detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.
•	Highlights:
o	Performed exploratory data analysis to understand transaction patterns.
o	Implemented classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG Boost) and evaluated them using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

•	Outcome: Achieved a reliable model to flag fraudulent transactions effectively.

2. Movie Rating Prediction
•	Objective: Predict user ratings for movies based on features such as genre, cast, and user preferences.
•	Highlights:
o	Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset by handling missing values and categorical features.
o	Explored correlations between movie attributes and user ratings.
o	Built and optimized regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, and Neural Networks).
o	Utilized collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for recommendations.

•	Outcome: Developed a predictive model and recommendation system for movie ratings.

3. Sales Prediction
•	Objective: Forecast sales for a retail store based on historical data and other influencing factors.
•	Highlights:
o	Analysed sales trends and seasonality using time series analysis.
o	Engineered features such as holiday effects and promotions to enhance predictions.
o	Implemented machine learning models like Gradient Boosting, and LSTM for time series forecasting. 
o	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAPE.

•	Outcome: Provided accurate sales forecasts to assist in inventory and resource planning.
